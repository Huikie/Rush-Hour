# Rush Hour

In Rush Hour, a sliding block logic game developed by ThinkFun, you have to battle the gridlock as you slide the blocking vehicles out of the way for the red car to exit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The codebase has been written in [Python3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In requirements.txt you can find all necessary packages to run the code successfully. You can easily install these packages using pip, simply use the instructions below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure

All python algorithms can be found in the folder algorithms, the code belonging to the board and cars can be found in the folder classes, the state-space calculations in the folder state-space and the results in the results folder.

### Testing

To use the code with a standard pre-defined board (in this case Board_3 with the Breadth first algorithm) use the following command:

```
python main.py
```
